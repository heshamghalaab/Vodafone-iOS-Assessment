## Dev Notes ##

### Design Pattern
- This project uses the **Model View View Model pattern**, as it has the below key values:
* **Better Separation of Concerns** The view model translates the data of the model layer into something the view layer can use. The controller is no longer responsible for this task.
* **Improved Testability** View controllers are notoriously hard to test because of their relation to the view layer. By migrating data manipulation to the view model, testing becomes much easier.
* **Transparent Communication** The responsibilities of the view controller are reduced to controlling the interaction between the view layer and the model layer, glueing both layers together. The view model provides a transparant interface to the view controller, which it uses to populate the view layer and interact with the model layer. This results in a transparant communication between the four layers of the application.

### Unit Testing
- The project uses XCTest for unit test.
